# DRIFT: Dead Reckoning In Field Time
<!-- ![all_robots](figures/drift_all_robots.gif?raw=true "Title") -->

## Description
DRIFT is a real-time symmetry-preserving propioceptive state estimation framework. The current implementation is based on the [Invariant Kalman Filtering (InEKF)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-control-060117-105010). By default, DRIFT supports legged robots, differential-drive wheeled robots, full-size vehicles with shaft encoders and marine robots with Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). 

DRIFT is designed to be modular and easy to expand to different platforms. It can be used as a standalone C++ library. Alternatively, we provide a ROS1 wrapper for easy communication between sensors. 

<!-- ## Framework

## Run Time Analysis
We perform runtime evaluations using a personal laptop with an Intel i5-11400H CPU and an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier (CPU). DRIFT can operate at an extremely high frequency using CPU-only computation, even on the resourced-constrained Jetson AGX Xavier. For the optional contact estimator, the inference speed on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU is approximately 1100 Hz, and the inference speed on a Jetson AGX Xavier (GPU) is around 830 Hz after TensorRT optimization.

# Dependencies
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 20.04** and **22.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms.

> ### C++17 Compiler
We use the threading functionalities of C++17.


> ### Eigen3
Required by header files. Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Requires at least 3.1.0**.

> ### Yaml-cpp
Required by header files. Download and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.

> ### ROS1 (Optional)
Building with ROS1 is optional. Instructions are [found below](https://github.com/UMich-CURLY/drift/tree/main#4-ros).

# Building DRIFT library

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/UMich-CURLY/drift.git
```
Create another directory which we will name 'build' and use cmake and make to compile an build project:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Install the library
After building the library, you can install the library to the system. This will allow other projects to find the library without needing to specify the path to the library. 

```
sudo make install
```
Then, you can include the library in your project by adding the following line to your CMakeLists.txt file:
```
find_package(drift REQUIRED)
```

# ROS
## Examples
We provide several examples in the `ROS/examples` directory. 

## Building the ROS1 node
1. Add `/ROS/drift` to the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` environment variable. Open your ~/.bashrc file in a text editor and add the following line to the end. Replace PATH/TO with the directory path to where you cloned drift:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/TO/drift/ROS/drift
  ```

  Then
  ```
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script in the repository root directory:

  ```
  cd <PATH>/<TO>/drift
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```

## Run examples
**Clearpath Husky robot:**
```
rosrun drift husky
```

**Fetch robot with the gyro filter:**
```
rosrun drift fetch
```

**Full-size vehicle:**
```
rosrun drift neya
```

**MIT mini-cheetah robot:**
```
rosrun drift mini_cheetah
```

**Girona500 (Marine robot):**
```
rosrun drift girona500
```
